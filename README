This is an implementation of the "Find Sophie" puzzle that Facebook created in
order to "test" potential employees.

See http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=11.

I never submitted this to FB because I don't have an FB account.

The sophie program has both a bruteforce mode and a heuristic which uses
simulated annealing.

> ./sophie -h
Usage: ./sophie [OPTION]... [FILE]

  -h, --help              display this help and exit
  -V, --version           output version information and exit
  -p, --print-path        Print tour for lowest time
Options controlling simulated annealing heuristics:
  -b, --brute-force       Use brute force to solve
  -i, --initial-temp      Set starting temp for simulated annealing
  -t, --steps-per-temp    Steps per temperature change
  -s, --cooling-steps     Numer of cooling steps
  -f, --cooling-fraction  Cooling fraction for exponent
  -k, --K                 K factor
  -r, --runs              Number of runs
  -v, --max-verts         How many verticies before using heuristic
  -z, --randomize         Randomize starting heuristic path

There are some test files in the tests directory. The file "fb4.fb" is the
example from the puzzle.

Now go find Sophie!
